# 🔐 Shadow Crypt

**Shadow Crypt** is a fully offline tool to **encrypt and decrypt** messages or passwords using layered logic, custom dictionaries, and Fernet cryptography — all without storing any data.

📅 **Launch Date**: May 15th, 2025 – 12:00 PM IST  
🔗 **GitHub**: [https://github.com/VeduStorm/shadow-crypt](https://github.com/VeduStorm/shadow-crypt)

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 **Encrypts and Decrypts** – Supports both directions via built-in logic
- 🔒 **Double Password Hashing** – Secures user-entered passwords with double hash
- 👥 **Multiple User Authentication** – Login system supports more than one user
- 🧠 **Fernet Encryption** – Ensures symmetric message security
- 🧾 **Custom Dictionaries**:
  - Standard Binary
  - Case-insensitive Morse Code
  - Modified Binary (flipped bit values)
  - Modified Morse (swapped characters for misleading outputs)

💡 **Offline Only** — no history is stored or tracked  
📤 **Only output is returned** (no cloud sync or logging)

## 🛠 Built With

- `Python`
- `PyQt5` – for UI
- `cryptography` – for Fernet-based message encryption

---

## 🧪 Tested On

- ✅ Mac Silicon M2
- ⚙️ Optimization for Windows, Linux, and Intel Macs coming soon

---

## 🚧 Planned Features

- Integration of a **more optimized model via Ollama**
- Optionally **encrypt output logs** (let us know if you'd like this!)
