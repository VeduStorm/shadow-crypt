## Features

- **Text Encryption/Decryption**: Securely encrypt and decrypt text using Fernet with 8-digit numeric keys.
- **Morse & Binary Translation**: Convert text to/from Morse and binary code in Authentic (standard) or Secret (custom) modes.
- **User Authentication**: SHA-256 hashed passwords with support for up to two users.
- **Modern GUI**: Intuitive interface with tabs for cryptography and dictionary operations.
- **Cross-Platform**: Optimised for macOS Silicon, with planned support for Windows and Linux.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VeduStorm/shadow-crypt.git
   cd shadow-crypt
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5 PySide6 cryptography python-dotenv hkdf smtplib 
   ```
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **First-Time Setup**: Create a user account with a username and password.
2. **Cryptography Tab**:
   - Enter text in the input field.
   - Generate or input an 8-digit key.
   - Click "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" to process the text.
3. **Dictionary Tab**:
   - Select Authentic or Secret mode.
   - Input text and choose "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" to translate to/from Morse or binary.
4. **Feedback**: After 2â€“5 days, complete the Survey Form to share your experience.

## Development Roadmap

- **v1.0.beta1** (May 11, 2025, 1:00 PM IST): Initial release with PyQt5, file-based encryption, and basic authentication.
- **v1.0.2** (May 15, 2025, 12:00 PM IST): PySide6 migration, simplified key generation, and stability improvements.
- **v2.0.alpha1** (May 17, 2025, 12:00 PM IST): Enhanced GUI, OTP password recovery, and HKDF key derivation.

**Future Plans**:

- Optimize GUI for accessibility and aesthetics.
